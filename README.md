# Getting_and_Cleaning_data

How it works :

I.    Download the dataset to my working directory and unzip.

II.   Load the dataset: X_train.txt, X_test.txt, Y_train.txt, Y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt, features.txt,    activity_labels.txt.

III.  Merges followings 
        X_train + X_test.txt
        Y_train +  Y_test.txt
        subject_train + subject_test
        
IV.   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

V.    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

VI.   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

VII.  From the data set in previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
